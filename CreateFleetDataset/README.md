#Fleet Dataset from Turbofun C-mpas Dataset.

Four scripts used to produce fleet dataset using Turbofun C-mpas Dataset with run to failure examples of FD001,FD002,FD003 and FD004 sets.

You can use each script to produce a dataset based on one of four sets provided by Turbofun C-mpas Dataset of NASA.

For more information about the process you can refer to paper.
